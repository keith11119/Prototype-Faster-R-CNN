# Prototype-Faster-R-CNN
Developed a Prototype based on Faster R-CNN and Meta R-CNN models with the aim in providing a more accurate and explainable object detection model for self driving. 
Changed the Meta Faster R CNN from FSOD focused model to solve general objection detecetion model.
Allowed BDD dataset to be trained in this model after being converted to VOC format
